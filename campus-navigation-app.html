                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Navigating a large university campus can be overwhelming for new students and visitors. This project aimed to design a mobile web app that provides a seamless and intuitive wayfinding experience, both indoors and outdoors.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>Existing navigation tools like Google Maps are not optimized for indoor spaces or campus-specific landmarks. Students often get lost trying to find classrooms, labs, and offices, leading to frustration and missed appointments.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Develop a user-friendly interface for quick and easy navigation.</li>
                    <li>Provide offline maps for areas with poor connectivity.</li>
                    <li>Incorporate indoor navigation for complex buildings.</li>
                    <li>Ensure accessibility features for users with disabilities.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>The project started with extensive user research, including surveys and interviews with students. Based on the findings, I created user personas and journey maps to identify pain points. I then designed wireframes and interactive prototypes in Figma, which were tested and refined through multiple iterations of user feedback.</p>

                <h2>Final Design / Screens</h2>
                <div class="image-placeholder">
                    <p>App dashboard, search functionality, turn-by-turn indoor navigation, and accessibility settings.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <p>The final design was a highly intuitive and accessible campus navigation app. User testing showed a significant reduction in the time it took for students to find their destinations. The offline and indoor navigation features were particularly well-received.</p>
