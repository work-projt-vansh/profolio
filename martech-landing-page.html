                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>This project focused on designing a B2B SaaS landing page for a marketing technology platform. The main objective was to generate qualified leads by clearly communicating the platform's value proposition and encouraging demo requests.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>B2B SaaS products often have complex features that are difficult to communicate to a non-technical audience. The challenge was to create a landing page that was both informative and persuasive, without overwhelming potential customers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clearly articulate the product's features and benefits.</li>
                    <li>Optimize for lead generation and demo requests.</li>
                    <li>Build credibility and trust with potential customers.</li>
                    <li>Create a scalable design that can be used for future marketing campaigns.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>I started by researching the target audience and competitive landscape. I then created a content hierarchy and wireframes to structure the page. The design was brought to life with high-fidelity mockups and interactive prototypes in Figma and Framer, focusing on a clean aesthetic and clear calls-to-action.</p>

            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h2>Final Design / Screens</h2>
                <div class="image-placeholder">
                    <p>Hero section with a strong value proposition, feature highlights with visuals, social proof (customer logos, testimonials), and a prominent demo request form.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <p>The final landing page design successfully balanced feature communication with a clean user experience. The clear calls-to-action and trust-building elements led to an increase in demo requests and a higher conversion rate.</p>
