                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>Many e-learning platforms suffer from low student engagement and high dropout rates. Users often feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of choices and lack a clear path to follow. The learning experience can also be isolating, with limited opportunities for interaction and collaboration.</p>
