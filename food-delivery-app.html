                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>This project involved designing a full-fledged food delivery app for both customers and restaurants. The goal was to create a seamless experience, from browsing menus to tracking deliveries, while also providing restaurants with an easy-to-use platform to manage their orders.</p>

            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>The food delivery market is crowded, but many apps lack a user-centered design. Customers often face confusing interfaces and a lack of personalization, while restaurants struggle with inefficient order management systems.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Design a clean, intuitive interface for both customer and restaurant apps.</li>
                    <li>Implement AI-powered recommendations to personalize the user experience.</li>
                    <li>Provide real-time order tracking for customers.</li>
                    <li>Create an efficient order management dashboard for restaurants.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>I conducted extensive market research and user interviews to understand the needs of both customers and restaurant owners. I then created detailed user flows, wireframes, and high-fidelity prototypes. The design was validated through usability testing with a diverse group of users.</p>

                <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <p>The final design was a comprehensive and user-friendly food delivery platform. The AI-powered recommendations and real-time tracking significantly enhanced the customer experience, while the intuitive restaurant dashboard streamlined order management.</p>
